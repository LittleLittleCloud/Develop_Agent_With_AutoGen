## Developing AI Agents using AutoGen
### Before you start
- Install python >= 3.8
- Install VSCode
- Create and activate your virtual environment

- Install the required packages
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Notebooks (Please comment)
- [x] [Hello World](HelloWorld.ipynb): Create your first AutoGen agent
- [ ] [Tool call, code execution and multi-modal]: Based on what already implemented in the first example, extend the assistant agent with code execution, tool call and multi-modal capabilities
- [ ] Human in the loop: Based on previous examples, add human in the loop to chat with the agent
- [ ] Multi-agent: Based on previous examples, add multiple agents with different characteristics
- [ ] HandOff: Based on previous examples, add handoff capabilities to transfer the conversation to a human agent
